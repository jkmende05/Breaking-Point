# Breaking-Point
Breaking Point: An Interactive Dashboard using Python and Power BI to Analyze Baseball Breaking Balls

### Using Python for Data Analysis
To get and process all the data, the Pandas and Pybaseball libraries were used. Pybaseball was used to retrieve all statcast pitch data for sliders, sweepers, and slurves using a function. These data frames were then saved and stored using .csv files. Due to the amount of data being retrieved, it took a significant amount of time to run the function. It is suggested that you use the existing .csv files found in this GitHub Repo instead of running that file again. For storage purposes, the original csv files (marked with _raw) are not included in this GitHub Repo, but the ones that are processed using Python and Pandas are saved here.

### Creating Dashboard with Power BI
Power BI was used to create the dashboard. Different interactive visuals, such as slicers, line charts, and cards, and a number of various measures were used to achieve the desired result.
